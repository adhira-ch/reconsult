Key Business Insights:
1. Pfizer's current infrastructure is not scalable enough to meet future data demands efficiently.
2. Cloud migration could address challenges in data accessibility and analytics.
3. Approximately 60% of Pfizer's applications are cloud-ready, while the rest (especially legacy systems) require re-architecting or replacement.
4. A phased migration approach, starting with cloud-ready applications, is recommended.
5. Preliminary estimates suggest that migrating to a cloud provider like AWS could result in a 20-30% cost reduction compared to maintaining on-premises infrastructure.
6. Data security and compliance are paramount concerns, and a comprehensive security strategy is needed.
7. Migration tools and a parallel run of the cloud and on-premises systems can minimize downtime and ensure operational continuity.
8. Change management, including training and support, is crucial for a successful transition.

Problems Identified:
1. Pfizer's current infrastructure is not scalable enough to meet future data demands efficiently.
2. Challenges in data accessibility and analytics.
3. Readiness of applications for cloud migration, with legacy systems requiring re-architecting or replacement.
4. Cost implications of cloud infrastructure, including re-architecting applications and potential staff training.
5. Data security and compliance, especially for a pharmaceutical company like Pfizer.
6. Minimizing downtime and disruption during the transition to cloud-based systems.
7. Organizational change management to ensure staff adaptation to the new system.

Specific Information in Bullets:
- Pfizer manages 500TB of data across 120 servers.
- Data growth rate is 15% annually.
- Approximately 60% of applications are cloud-ready.
- Preliminary estimate for migrating to a cloud provider like AWS is $2.5 million annually.
- Cloud migration represents a 20-30% cost reduction compared to maintaining on-premises infrastructure.
- Data security measures include encryption, access controls, and regular audits.
- Migration tools and parallel run can minimize downtime.
- Change management plan should focus on training, communication, and stakeholder engagement.

Potential Actionable Insights:
1. Conduct a thorough assessment of Pfizer's current IT infrastructure, identifying scalability limitations and challenges in data accessibility and analytics.
2. Categorize applications into cloud-ready and legacy systems requiring re-architecting or replacement.
3. Develop a phased migration approach, starting with cloud-ready applications to gain momentum and address complexities in subsequent phases.
4. Estimate the costs involved in migrating to a cloud provider, considering storage, compute, network services, and potential application re-architecting and staff training.
5. Develop a comprehensive security strategy, including encryption, access controls, and regular audits, to ensure compliance with healthcare regulations and data protection.
6. Utilize migration tools and implement a parallel run of the cloud and on-premises systems during the transition phase to minimize downtime and ensure operational continuity.
7. Develop a change management plan that focuses on training, communication, and stakeholder engagement to support staff adaptation to the new system.
8. Compile detailed insights into a proposal, including strategy, timeline, cost analysis, and a risk management framework.
