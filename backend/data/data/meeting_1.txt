Priya Agarwal (BCG): Good morning, everyone. Let's begin by outlining the main objectives for today's meeting: understanding Pfizer's current IT infrastructure, discussing the transition to a cloud-based system, and identifying key challenges and strategies.

Ryan Reynolds (Pfizer): Thanks, Priya. As you know, our current infrastructure is predominantly on-site. We're looking at a cloud solution to enhance scalability and efficiency, particularly as our data needs grow.

Adhira (Pfizer): To give you an overview, we currently manage about 500TB of data across 120 servers. Our data growth rate is around 15% annually, but our current infrastructure isn't scalable enough to meet future demands efficiently.

Abhishek Pillai (Pfizer): And while our system is robust, we've identified challenges in data accessibility and analytics. Cloud migration could address these issues, but we're concerned about the complexities involved in the transition.

Kiara Sanders (BCG): Let's break down these challenges. Firstly, the readiness of your applications for cloud migration. Do you have an inventory of applications that are cloud-ready versus those that require significant modifications?

Abhishek Pillai (Pfizer): Yes, we've categorized our applications. Approximately 60% are cloud-ready, but the rest, especially our legacy systems, need either re-architecting or replacement.

Colin Scott (BCG): Based on this, a phased migration approach would be ideal. We could start with cloud-ready applications to gain momentum and address the more complex systems in subsequent phases.

Rob Johnson (Pfizer): That makes sense. But what about the costs involved? Do we have an estimate for the cloud infrastructure?

Colin Scott (BCG): Preliminary estimates suggest that migrating to a cloud provider like AWS could cost around $2.5 million annually. This is a ballpark figure, considering storage, compute, and network services. But, it represents a 20-30% cost reduction compared to maintaining on-premises infrastructure.

Adhira (Pfizer): We also need to factor in the costs of re-architecting applications and potential training for our staff.

Priya Agarwal (BCG): Absolutely, Adhira. Now, let's talk about the elephant in the room - data security and compliance. Migrating to the cloud poses unique challenges, especially for a pharmaceutical company like Pfizer.

Rob Johnson (Pfizer): Yes, data security is paramount. We need to ensure that our cloud infrastructure is compliant with healthcare regulations like HIPAA and has robust data protection measures.

Kiara Sanders (BCG): Cloud providers offer strong security features, but it's also about how you configure and manage these settings. We'll need to develop a comprehensive security strategy, including encryption, access controls, and regular audits.

Ryan Reynolds (Pfizer): And what about the timeline? We can't afford significant downtime or disruption to our operations.

Priya Agarwal (BCG): We recommend using migration tools for live data transfer, which minimizes downtime. Also, a parallel run of the cloud and on-premises systems during the transition phase will ensure operational continuity.

Abhishek Pillai (Pfizer): Finally, let's touch upon change management. This migration isn't just a technical shift but also an organizational one.

Adhira (Pfizer): Correct, Abhishek. We'll need a solid plan for training and support to help our staff adapt to the new system.

Kiara Sanders (BCG): We can assist with developing a change management plan, focusing on training, communication, and stakeholder engagement.

Priya Agarwal (BCG): To conclude, our next steps will be to compile these insights into a detailed proposal. This will include strategy, timeline, cost analysis, and a risk management framework.

Ryan Reynolds (Pfizer): Thank you, everyone, for a fruitful discussion. We're looking forward to BCG's proposal and to a successful partnership in this transformation journey.
