Dear Priya Agarwal,



I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to you in my capacity as a

Director at Pfizer, with an earnest request for the expertise and guidance

of Boston Consulting Group in a crucial transformation initiative we are

undertaking.



At Pfizer, we are at a pivotal juncture in evolving our IT infrastructure.

The current on-site IT system, which has served us well over the years, is

now facing the inevitable need for modernization. Our goal is to transition

to a cloud-based infrastructure, which we believe is imperative for

enhanced efficiency, scalability, and to support our growing global

operations.



This transition is not just a technical upgrade but a significant change in

our operational model. It requires a strategic approach, careful planning,

and an execution plan that minimizes disruption to our ongoing activities.

We are particularly focused on ensuring that this transformation aligns

with our broader organizational goals, including digital innovation, data

security, and regulatory compliance.



Given BCG's renowned expertise in digital transformations and your personal

experience in managing complex IT projects, we believe that your guidance

will be invaluable in this endeavor. We are looking for support in the

following areas:





   1. Strategic Planning: Developing a comprehensive strategy that outlines

   the transition from our current on-site systems to a cloud-based

   infrastructure.

   2. Risk Assessment and Mitigation: Identifying potential risks

   associated with this transition and devising strategies to mitigate them.

   3. Change Management: Ensuring smooth adoption of the new system across

   all levels of our organization, with a focus on training and communication.

   4. Regulatory Compliance and Data Security: Ensuring the new

   infrastructure meets the stringent regulatory requirements of the

   pharmaceutical industry and enhances our data security measures.





We are keen to set up a meeting at your earliest convenience to discuss

this project in detail. We believe that with BCG's expertise, we can

navigate this transformation effectively and set a new benchmark in

pharmaceutical IT infrastructure.



Thank you for considering our request. I look forward to the possibility of

working together and am eager to hear your thoughts on how we can

collaboratively achieve this significant milestone for Pfizer.



Best regards,



Adhira Choudhury

Senior Director- Analytics Engineering, Pfizer Inc.
