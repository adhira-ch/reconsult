Dear Priya Agarwal,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to you in my capacity as a
Director at Pfizer, with an earnest request for the expertise and guidance
of Boston Consulting Group in a crucial transformation initiative we are
undertaking.

At Pfizer, we are at a pivotal juncture in evolving our IT infrastructure.
The current on-site IT system, which has served us well over the years, is
now facing the inevitable need for modernization. Our goal is to transition
to a cloud-based infrastructure, which we believe is imperative for
enhanced efficiency, scalability, and to support our growing global
operations.

This transition is not just a technical upgrade but a significant change in
our operational model. It requires a strategic approach, careful planning,
and an execution plan that minimizes disruption to our ongoing activities.
We are particularly focused on ensuring that this transformation aligns
with our broader organizational goals, including digital innovation, data
security, and regulatory compliance.

Given BCG's renowned expertise in digital transformations and your personal
experience in managing complex IT projects, we believe that your guidance
will be invaluable in this endeavor. We are looking for support in the
following areas:


   1. Strategic Planning: Developing a comprehensive strategy that outlines
   the transition from our current on-site systems to a cloud-based
   infrastructure.
   2. Risk Assessment and Mitigation: Identifying potential risks
   associated with this transition and devising strategies to mitigate them.
   3. Change Management: Ensuring smooth adoption of the new system across
   all levels of our organization, with a focus on training and communication.
   4. Regulatory Compliance and Data Security: Ensuring the new
   infrastructure meets the stringent regulatory requirements of the
   pharmaceutical industry and enhances our data security measures.


We are keen to set up a meeting at your earliest convenience to discuss
this project in detail. We believe that with BCG's expertise, we can
navigate this transformation effectively and set a new benchmark in
pharmaceutical IT infrastructure.

Thank you for considering our request. I look forward to the possibility of
working together and am eager to hear your thoughts on how we can
collaboratively achieve this significant milestone for Pfizer.

Best regards,

Senior Director- Analytics Engineering, Pfizer Inc.
