Subject: Request for Proposal (RFP) for IT Infrastructure Transformation
From: Adhira Choudhury <28adhirac@gmail.com>

Dear Priya,

I have reviewed the workshop summary and am impressed with the depth of
insight BCG has already demonstrated. To move forward, Pfizer would like to
formally request a comprehensive proposal from Boston Consulting Group for
our IT infrastructure transformation project.

We are particularly interested in detailed strategies for the following:

- Cloud Migration Plan: Including timelines, milestones, and resource
allocation.
- Risk Management Framework: Specifically focusing on data security and
regulatory compliance.
- Change Management Strategy: Outlining training, communication plans, and
stakeholder engagement.

We are eager to see how BCG can help us navigate this crucial
transformation. Looking forward to your proposal.

Best regards,

Thomas Reynolds
Senior Vice President, Pfizer Inc.
