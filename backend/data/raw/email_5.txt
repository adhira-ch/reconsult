Dear Priya,



I have reviewed the workshop summary and am impressed with the depth of

insight BCG has already demonstrated. To move forward, Pfizer would like to

formally request a comprehensive proposal from Boston Consulting Group for

our IT infrastructure transformation project.



We are particularly interested in detailed strategies for the following:



- Cloud Migration Plan: Including timelines, milestones, and resource

allocation.

- Risk Management Framework: Specifically focusing on data security and

regulatory compliance.

- Change Management Strategy: Outlining training, communication plans, and

stakeholder engagement.



We are eager to see how BCG can help us navigate this crucial

transformation. Looking forward to your proposal.



Best regards,



Ryan Reynolds

Senior Vice President, Pfizer Inc.
