Let's begin by outlining the main objectives for today's meeting: understanding Pfizer's current IT infrastructure, discussing the transition to a cloud-based system, and identifying key challenges and strategies.<br><br>Ryan Reynolds (Pfizer): Thanks, Priya. As you know, our current infrastructure is predominantly on-site. We're looking at a cloud solution to enhance scalability and efficiency, particularly as our data needs grow.<br><br>Adhira (Pfizer): To give you an overview, we currently manage about 500TB of data across 120 servers. Our data growth rate is around 15% annually, but our current infrastructure isn't scalable enough to meet future demands efficiently.<br><br>Abhishek Pillai (Pfizer): And while our system is robust, we've identified challenges in data accessibility and analytics. Cloud migration could address these issues, but we're concerned about the complexities involved in the transition.<br><br>Kiara Sanders (BCG): Let's break down these challenges. Firstly, the readiness of your applications for cloud migration. Do you have an inventory of applications that are cloud-ready versus those that require significant modifications?<br><br>Abhishek Pillai (Pfizer): Yes, we've categorized our applications. Approximately 60% are cloud-ready, but the rest, especially our legacy systems, need either re-architecting or replacement.<br><br>Colin Scott (BCG): Based on this, a phased migration approach would be ideal. We could start with cloud-ready applications to gain momentum and address the more complex systems in subsequent phases.<br><br>Rob Johnson (Pfizer): That makes sense. But what about the costs involved? Do we have an estimate for the cloud infrastructure?<br><br>Colin Scott (BCG): Preliminary estimates suggest that migrating to a cloud provider like AWS could cost around $2.5 million annually. This is a ballpark figure, considering storage, compute, and network services. But, it represents a 20-30% cost reduction compared to maintaining on-premises infrastructure.<br><br>Adhira (Pfizer): We also need to factor in the costs of re-architecting applications and potential training for our staff.<br><br>Priya Agarwal (BCG): Absolutely, Adhira. Now, let's talk about the elephant in the room - data security and compliance. Migrating to the cloud poses unique challenges, especially for a pharmaceutical company like Pfizer.<br><br>Rob Johnson (Pfizer): Yes, data security is paramount. We need to ensure that our cloud infrastructure is compliant with healthcare regulations like HIPAA and has robust data protection measures.<br><br>Kiara Sanders (BCG): Cloud providers offer strong security features, but it's also about how you configure and manage these settings. We'll need to develop a comprehensive security strategy, including encryption, access controls, and regular audits.<br><br>Ryan Reynolds (Pfizer): And what about the timeline? We can't afford significant downtime or disruption to our operations.<br><br>Priya Agarwal (BCG): We recommend using migration tools for live data transfer, which minimizes downtime. Also, a parallel run of the cloud and on-premises systems during the transition phase will ensure operational continuity.<br><br>Abhishek Pillai (Pfizer): Finally, let's touch upon change management. This migration isn't just a technical shift but also an organizational one.<br><br>Adhira (Pfizer): Correct, Abhishek. We'll need a solid plan for training and support to help our staff adapt to the new system.<br><br>Kiara Sanders (BCG): We can assist with developing a change management plan, focusing on training, communication, and stakeholder engagement.<br><br>Priya Agarwal (BCG): To conclude, our next steps will be to compile these insights into a detailed proposal. This will include strategy, timeline, cost analysis, and a risk management framework.<br><br>Ryan Reynolds (Pfizer): Thank you, everyone, for a fruitful discussion. We're looking forward to BCG's proposal and to a successful partnership in this transformation journey.</p></div>
