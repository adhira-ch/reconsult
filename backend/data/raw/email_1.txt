I am writing to you in my capacity as a<br>Director at Pfizer, with an earnest request for the expertise and guidance<br>of Boston Consulting Group in a crucial transformation initiative we are<br>undertaking.<br><br>At Pfizer, we are at a pivotal juncture in evolving our IT infrastructure.<br>The current on-site IT system, which has served us well over the years, is<br>now facing the inevitable need for modernization. Our goal is to transition<br>to a cloud-based infrastructure, which we believe is imperative for<br>enhanced efficiency, scalability, and to support our growing global<br>operations.<br><br>This transition is not just a technical upgrade but a significant change in<br>our operational model. It requires a strategic approach, careful planning,<br>and an execution plan that minimizes disruption to our ongoing activities.<br>We are particularly focused on ensuring that this transformation aligns<br>with our broader organizational goals, including digital innovation, data<br>security, and regulatory compliance.<br><br>Given BCG's renowned expertise in digital transformations and your personal<br>experience in managing complex IT projects, we believe that your guidance<br>will be invaluable in this endeavor. We are looking for support in the<br>following areas:<br><br>1. Strategic Planning: Developing a comprehensive strategy that outlines<br>the transition from our current on-site systems to a cloud-based<br>infrastructure.<br>2. Risk Assessment and Mitigation: Identifying potential risks<br>associated with this transition and devising strategies to mitigate them.<br>3. Change Management: Ensuring smooth adoption of the new system across<br>all levels of our organization, with a focus on training and communication.<br>4. Regulatory Compliance and Data Security: Ensuring the new<br>infrastructure meets the stringent regulatory requirements of the<br>pharmaceutical industry and enhances our data security measures.<br><br>We are keen to set up a meeting at your earliest convenience to discuss<br>this project in detail. We believe that with BCG's expertise, we can<br>navigate this transformation effectively and set a new benchmark in<br>pharmaceutical IT infrastructure.<br><br>Thank you for considering our request. I look forward to the possibility of<br>working together and am eager to hear your thoughts on how we can<br>collaboratively achieve this significant milestone for Pfizer.<br><br>Best regards,<br><br>Adhira Choudhury<br>Senior Director- Analytics Engineering, Pfizer Inc.</p></div>
